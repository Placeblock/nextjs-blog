I am currently working on a Minecraft server network with a development team. 
For this we implemented many different game modes one of which is played inside
some sort of generated dungeon. At first we began to build them on our own, but
then we thought about generationg the dungeons procedurally. This means to create
data with defined algorithms, rather then by yourself. In our case this data is
a dungeon. For a couple days I searched the internet for algorithms to generate 
interesting dungeons. I stumbled over the so called tunneling algorithm. 
This algorithms has little digital miners with specific rules which dig tunnels 
and rooms. However, this algorithm is rather hard to implement. 

Then I looked into dungeon generation using B-Trees. B-Trees are quite simple to understand. 
You take a square, which is the boundary for the dungeon. Then you split this square in half somewhere. 
The algorithm chooses between horizontal and vertical split as well as the split position randomly. 
This step is repeated for each of the new squares until a fixed minimum size is reached. 
Each square is the bounding box of one room. All you have to do now is to connect the 
rooms using lines as paths and the dungeon is fully generated.

This works as expected, but it does not look really natural. There are often many rooms 
connected by a single straight path. The biggest disadvantage with this algorithm is that 
a path does not lead back to other paths but just has a dead end somewhere. It looks like 
a circuit with one controller in the center and many cables which start at the controller 
and fork but never join back together. This is not what you expect from an interesting dungeon. 

In math and software engineering there is this topic called “graph theory” which is all about 
little dots called nodes connected by edges, like a computer network. 

In the end a dungeon 
is nothing else then dots (rooms) connected by edges (paths). In math and software engineering

A user in an online forum mentioned the relative neighborhood graph in connection with 
dungeon generation1. There is some information about this graph in the internet, but 
not much especially if it comes to dungeon generation. The Relative Neighborhood 
Graph looks a lot more natural and allows loops inside the graph. I experimented 
with it a lot. My goal with this post is to share my achievements and experiences 
with you and explain additional algorithms to create a fully fledged dungeon.
